# COVID-19 Exploratory Analysis

This project focuses on conducting an exploratory analysis of COVID-19 data sourced from Our World in Data [link](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths). The objective is to gain insights into the global impact of the pandemic and present the findings through Tableau visualizations.

## Data Exploration
1. Total Death Percentage Worldwide:
    * Calculate the total percentage of people who have died globally.
    * Utilize the "CovidDeaths22" dataset, filtering out records without continent information.

2. Countries with the Highest Death Count per Continent:
    * Identify and showcase the countries with the highest death count on each continent.
    * Exclude records for the World, European Union, International, and entries related to income levels.
  
3. Countries with the Highest Infection Rate Relative to Population:
    * Explore countries with the highest infection rate compared to their population.
    * Calculate the percentage of the population infected and present the results.

4. Daily Infection Rate Variation by Country:
    * Examine the countries with the highest infection rate relative to their population on each day.
    * Investigate daily variations in infection rates and highlight significant trends.
  
## Data Visualization
1. Loading Data to Tableau:
      * Load the cleaned and processed data into Tableau for visualization.
      * Structure the data in a way that facilitates dynamic and interactive dashboard creation.

2. Tableau Dashboard Creation:
      * Utilize Tableau to design an interactive dashboard that showcases key COVID-19 metrics.
      * Include visualizations such as maps, charts, and graphs to enhance data representation.

3. Public Dashboard Deployment:
      * Deploy the Tableau dashboard to a public platform for universal access.
      * Ensure the dashboard is user-friendly, informative, and accessible to a wide audience.
